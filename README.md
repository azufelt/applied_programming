# Overview

As a software engineer my goal is to develop tools that accomplish a meaningful task to improve life and the digital experience for the end-user. I believe that easy-to-use tools are the tools that get used. Ensuring a tool or application is able to be accessed and used by its intended audience is one of the most important features of development.
